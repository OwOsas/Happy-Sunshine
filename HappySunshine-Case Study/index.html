        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This project is to create a food ordering web app to allow the customers from Happy Sunshine food truck to
            have a better experience when ordering their food, allowing them to avoid the line and the wait. I worked as
            the primary developer being responsible of the development of the project, making what was on the paper come
            to life.
        </p>
        <h3>Context & Challenges</h3>
        <p>
            In this project, we worked in a 5 people group, each responsible for a role of tasks, and I was the primary
            developer in the team, responsible for the front-end and back-end development.
            <br><br>
            The goal of this project is to collaborate with each team members and work as a group, and delivering a
            working product in 3 months.

        <p>
            We inherited the prototype from a previous class that the original goal was to create a mobile application
            for the food truck.
            <br><br>
            We then compiled the persona, journey map, style guide from the previous class and then further refining
            them.

            We were faced with the challenge of making the prototype for not only the mobile format but also for tablet
            and desktop version.
            <br><br>
            As the primary developer, I started to prototype the structure of the database and working on the mobile version of the website. Later on, making the website responsive and dynamically generating content using the database.
            <br><br>
            The big challenge I faced was the large amount of work that needed to be done due to the badly designed team structure, and me being the single developer, was basically creating the whole website on my own. Luckily, the team managed to redistribute the work load between team members and in the later on stages, I mainly focused on the back-end development, integrating the database while the designer helping me with the front-end styling.
            <br><br>
            In the end, as a team, we managed to create a working product under 3 months.
